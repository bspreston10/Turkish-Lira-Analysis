# Market Overview
The Turkish Lira (TRY) serves as Turkey’s official currency and plays a critical role in regional trade, investments, and financial stability. Positioned as a bridge between the Middle East and Europe, Turkey’s economy and currency are highly sensitive to regional geopolitical dynamics, particularly the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis.
Turkey’s geographical importance is emphasized by its control of the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits, which serve as the sole maritime access points between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. This control has granted Turkey considerable geopolitical leverage, as demonstrated during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, where Turkey invoked the Montreux Convention to restrict the movement of warships while maintaining a role as a mediator. However, Turkey’s ability to balance Western and Russian interests also highlights the complex geopolitical risks it faces, which directly impact investor sentiment and the stability of the TRY.
Historically, the TRY has shown vulnerability to geopolitical shocks, particularly during the Arab Spring (2010–2011) and the escalation of the Syrian Civil War, which triggered mass displacement and migration. Turkey emerged as the primary host for Syrian refugees, absorbing millions of displaced people and facing significant economic and fiscal strain. The increased pressure on public infrastructure, rising fiscal expenditures, and strained foreign reserves have had a cascading effect on market liquidity, investor confidence, and TRY volatility.
In addition to the fiscal challenges of hosting refugees, Turkey’s role as a gatekeeper for Europe has further entrenched its exposure to migration-related risks. Agreements such as the 2016 EU-Turkey migration deal, which provided financial aid in exchange for limiting refugee flows, highlight the interconnectedness of Turkey’s economic stability and regional migration dynamics.
This report focuses on the potential economic and financial risks stemming from a significant increase in refugee inflows, modeling their impact on market liquidity, foreign reserves, and investor sentiment. By stress-testing scenarios that range from moderate to severe refugee surges, this analysis aims to quantify the impact on the Turkish Lira and provide insight into Turkey’s vulnerability to sustained geopolitical pressures.

# Executive Summary
This report assesses the economic and financial risks to Turkey’s economy, focusing on the Turkish Lira (TRY), under increasing refugee inflows. Stress testing was conducted to model Moderate (50%), High (100%), and Severe (150%) refugee inflow scenarios. The analysis examines the impact on key financial metrics, including foreign exchange reserves, inflation rates, bid-ask spreads, and TRY volatility.
Key Findings:
-	Severe Stress Scenario (150% Increase in Refugees):
-	The Turkish Lira depreciates significantly, with the TRY closing price rising from $34.24 to ~$40.00, a 16.8% decline against the USD.
-	Foreign Exchange Reserves deplete by 4.2%, increasing risks of a currency crisis and external funding shortfalls.
-	Market liquidity deteriorates as the Bid-Ask Spread widens by 33%, reflecting investor flight and elevated transaction costs.
-	Inflationary pressures intensify, with the MoM inflation rate increasing to 2.87% (+6.7%), exacerbating economic strain.
-	Progression Across Stress Scenarios:
-	Moderate Stress (50%): Early warning signs include a 1.4% decline in reserves and a 10.9% widening of the bid-ask spread, signaling initial market instability.
-	High Stress (100%): These trends accelerate, with reserves falling by 2.79% and spreads widening by 21.7%, indicating escalating investor uncertainty and liquidity concerns.

# Stress Test Scenarios
The stress tests are anchored in historical trends observed in 2015, when Turkey experienced a significant ~150% increase in refugee inflows over a 3-month period. To model the moderate (50%) and high (100%) stress levels, we proportionally scale the impacts observed during the 150% increase, ensuring consistency and comparability across scenarios
